## General Information
This is an HTML and Javascript module that can be used to search and embed HHS Digital Media content.  Modules for specific content management systems such as Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal, and DotNetNuke have all been implemented using this project as a starting point.  If you have a CMS without a specific module already implemented you can use this to build your own custom module.

## Use
To test the functionality deploy the files in this repo to your web server and hit index.html
